# ESP-BLE-HID

This library allows you to make the ESP32 act as a Bluetooth Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad, or other [HID device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device).

ESP-BLE-HID is intended to serve as an ESP32-based alternative to tools like QMK and ZMK with added support for advanced features.

All development/testing is performed on boards *without* USB host mode, like the ESP32-C3 Super Mini.

  esp.moveTo(1000, 1000, 1, 1); // Just like 'move', 'moveTo' also allows you to set the state of the vertical and horizontal mouse wheels.
  delay(2000);

  esp.click(MOUSE_LEFT);    // The 'click' function is the mouse's version of the 'write' function. I decided to call it 'click' because 'write' seemed confusing in this context.
  delay(2000);

  esp.click(5000, 5000, MOUSE_LEFT); // Just like the 'moveTo' function, 'click' is able to parse absolute coordinates. (By default, it will just click wherever the cursor is.)

## API docs
The interface is designed to copy the aliases used by keycodes in QMK. The aliases and functions for all [QMK Basic Keycodes](https://docs.qmk.fm/keycodes_basic) are fully implemented.
The sole exceptions to this are `KC_ASST` and `KC_MCTL`, which have been excluded from this library because I have no idea what either are meant to do.

A complete list of all available keycodes and commands is included in the `keywords.txt` text file.

To illustrate what this library has to offer, below is a table including the current complete list of the available **media** keycodes alongside the available **appearance codes**. **Media** keycodes are self-explanatory, however **appearance codes** require more elaboration.

ESP-BLE-HID uses **appearance codes** to determine what type of device the ESP32 advertises itself as to hosts. This corresponds to the icon next to the name of the device visible when scanning for Bluetooth devices to pair to, alongside the accompanying text explaining what the device does that is visible to the user on some operating systems. Every appearance code is tested and working.

Features and settings that existed in the original project this repo is a fork of are still available:
You don't have to declare `BleKeyboard bleKeyboard;` before using `bleKeyboard.setName("NAME")` and `bleKeyboard.setBatteryLevel(100)`! 
You can instead change `BleKeyboard bleKeyboard;` to `BleKeyboard bleKeyboard("NAME", "MANUFACTURER", 100);`. (Names longer than 15 characters will be truncated.)
By default the battery level will be set to 100%, the device name will be `ESP32 Keyboard` and the manufacturer will be `Espressif`.  

There is also a `setDelay` method to set a delay between each key event. E.g. `bleKeyboard.setDelay(10)` (10 milliseconds). The default is `8`. The `setDelay` feature is to maximize compatibility between any devices created using this library, and any underpowered hardware or legacy applications one may wish to use.

## NimBLE-Mode
The NimBLE mode enables a significant saving of RAM and FLASH memory.

The ESP32-C3 Super Mini was used for these tests and comparisons, which are now up-to-date!

### Comparison (SendKeyStrokes.ino)

**Standard**
```
RAM:   [=         ]   12% (used 40088 bytes out of the 327680 bytes in total)
Flash: [========  ]   83% (used 1097410 bytes out of the 1310720 bytes in total)
```

**NimBLE mode**
```
RAM:   [=         ]   7% (used 23568 bytes out of the 327680 bytes in total)
Flash: [====      ]  46% (used 612884 bytes out of the 1310720 bytes in total)
```

## How to activate NimBLE mode?

### ArduinoIDE: 
Uncomment the first line in BleKeyboard.h
```C++
#define USE_NIMBLE
```
