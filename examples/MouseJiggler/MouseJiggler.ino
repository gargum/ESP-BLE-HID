/**
 * This example takes an ESP32, and turns it into a PIN-protected BLE mouse jiggler that falsely reports itself to be an insulin pump.
 *
 * Designed for use on all operating systems. Tested and working on mobile.
 *
 * Boards like the ESP32-C3 Super Mini, which this example was originally tested on, make this especially useful!
